		<h2>My experience</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>I visited Japan in May/June 2017 with my girlfriend and
		we immediately fell in love with the country. </p>

		<p>We started our journey in Tokyo and stayed there for 
		several nights, with a day trip to Kamakura fit in. We then moved on to historic Kyoto, 
		taking in the Japan of old. From Kyoto we moved down to Hiroshima briefly, and then on to 
		the island of Miyajima. From there we went to the mountainous region of 
		Koya San, staying in a monastery for the night. We then left for Osaka for 
		the last part of our journey, even manaing to fit a day trip to Nara to see the deer 
		and old temples. Finally we flew out of Osaka, exhauseted but happy due to the incredible 
		experience we had over a two week period. </p>

		<p>As money was tight (Japan can be a very expensive place!) we stayed in small Airbnb 
			apartments for the most part of the trip - even 
		though it is technically banned...</p>

		<p>The weather was also incredible when we visited. We arrived right after the cherry blossom
		season, so it was coming into summer. We were blessed with 25 degrees C for most days
		and it rarely rained.</p>
